    I need you to check the Kubernetes cluster for Pods in the gk-container-cpu-requests-memory-limits-and-requests namespace.  We require that all containers in those Pods define memory limits, as well as CPU and memory requests. Please identify any Pods that don't meet this requirement.
    
    For each violating resource, print one line in this format:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-003"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-004"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-005"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-002"
isolation: cluster
