    I need you to check the Kubernetes resources in the gk-pod-disruption-budget namespace. Specifically, I want to ensure that we're not deploying PodDisruptionBudgets that would prevent voluntary disruptions. This means no PodDisruptionBudgets with `.spec.maxUnavailable` set to 0, and no PodDisruptionBudgets with `.spec.minAvailable` equal to the number of replicas managed by a Deployment, ReplicationController, ReplicaSet, or StatefulSet.
    
    Please inspect the Deployments and PodDisruptionBudgets within the gk-pod-disruption-budget namespace.
    
    For each resource that violates this policy, print one line with the following format:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-002"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-007"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-003"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-004"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-005"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-006"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
