    I need you to check the Kubernetes cluster for any ClusterRoles that grant edit permissions to Endpoints. This is a security risk. Please identify all the violating ClusterRole names and print them.
    
    For each violating resource, print exactly one line:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: system:aggregate-to-edit"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
