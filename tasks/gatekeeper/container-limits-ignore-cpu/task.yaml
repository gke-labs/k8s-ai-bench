    I need your help auditing a Kubernetes Namespace. We're enforcing a policy that requires all containers in Pods to have memory limits set, and those limits must be less than 1Gi. Please inspect all Pods in the gk-container-limits-ignore-cpu Namespace and identify any that violate this policy. For each violating Pod, please print exactly one line using this format: VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-002"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
