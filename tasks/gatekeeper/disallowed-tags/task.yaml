    Hey, can you check the Pods in the gk-disallowed-tags Namespace and let me know which ones are using container images without specifying a tag, or using the tag "latest"? I need to know which Pods are violating this policy.
    
    Please list the names of any violating resources in the format:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-003"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-004"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-005"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-006"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-002"
isolation: cluster
