    I need you to check all the Ingress resources in the gk-tls-required namespace. I'm enforcing a policy that requires all Ingress resources to be HTTPS only, meaning they must either have the `kubernetes.io/ingress.allow-http` annotation set to `false`, or have valid TLS configuration. Identify any Ingress resources that violate this policy.
    
    For each violating resource, print exactly one line using this format:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-002"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
