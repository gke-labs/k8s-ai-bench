    I need you to check for Pods in the gk-repo-must-not-be-k8s-gcr-io Namespace.
    Any Pod that uses a container image from a disallowed repository needs to be reported.
    We don't allow images from repositories starting with "k8s.gcr.io/".
    
    Please identify the names of any Pods that violate this policy, and report each violation in the format:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-002"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-003"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-004"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
