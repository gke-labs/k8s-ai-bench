    I need you to check for any Pods in the gk-repo-must-not-be-k8s-gcr-io Namespace that use container images from disallowed repositories. Specifically, any image that comes from a k8s.gcr.io repository is not allowed. Please list the names of any Pods that violate this policy.
    
    For each violating resource, print exactly one line:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-002"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-003"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-004"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
isolation: cluster
