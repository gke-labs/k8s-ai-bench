    I need to check some Kubernetes Pods in the gk-ephemeral-storage-limit Namespace. The policy we're enforcing requires all containers to have an ephemeral storage limit set, and that limit must be no more than 500Mi. Can you identify any Pods in that namespace that violate this policy?
    
    For each violating resource, print exactly one line:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-003"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-004"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-005"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-002"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
