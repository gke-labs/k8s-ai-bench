    I need your help auditing our Kubernetes cluster. We're enforcing a policy that requires all containers to have an ephemeral storage limit set, and that the limit must be no more than 500Mi.
    
    Could you please examine the Pods in the gk-ephemeral-storage-limit Namespace and identify any that violate this policy?
    
    For each violating resource, please print exactly one line:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-003"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-004"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-005"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-002"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
