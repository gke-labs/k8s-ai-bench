    I need you to check the Pods in the gk-memory-and-cpu-ratios Namespace.  We're enforcing a policy that requires container resource limits to requests ratios to be no higher than 1 for memory and 10 for CPU.  Please identify any Pods that violate this policy by name.
    
    For each violating resource, print exactly one line:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-002"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
