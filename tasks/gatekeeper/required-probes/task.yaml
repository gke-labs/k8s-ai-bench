    Hey, I need your help checking some Kubernetes Pods in the gk-required-probes Namespace.
    We require all Pods to have at least one readiness and/or liveness probe defined.
    Can you please identify any Pods in that Namespace that are missing these probes?
    
    For each violating resource, please print one line in the format:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-002"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-003"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
