    I need your help identifying Kubernetes Pods that don't have both readiness and liveness probes defined. Please check all Pods in the gk-required-probes Namespace and tell me which ones are missing either probe.
    
    For each violating resource, print exactly one line:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-002"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-003"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
