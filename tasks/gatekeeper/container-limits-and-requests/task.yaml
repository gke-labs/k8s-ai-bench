    I need you to check the Pods in the gk-container-limits-and-requests namespace. Our policy requires all containers to define both CPU and memory limits and requests. Please identify any Pods in that namespace that violate this policy.
    
    For each violating resource, print exactly one line in this format:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-002"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-003"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-004"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
