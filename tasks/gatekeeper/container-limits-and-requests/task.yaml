    I need you to check some resources in my Kubernetes cluster. Specifically, I want to make sure all containers in the gk-container-limits-and-requests Namespace have both CPU and memory limits and requests defined. Can you check the Pod resources in that Namespace and tell me which ones violate this policy?
    
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-002"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-003"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-004"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
isolation: cluster
