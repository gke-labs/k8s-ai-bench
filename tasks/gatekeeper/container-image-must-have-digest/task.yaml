    I need to check the Pods running in the gk-container-image-must-have-digest namespace to ensure all container images are specified using a digest (sha256). Can you tell me which Pods violate this policy?
    
    Report each violating Pod name on a separate line using the format: VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-002"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
