    I need you to check all the Pods in the gk-container-image-must-have-digest Namespace. We require all container images to be specified with a digest, not just a tag. Can you identify any Pods that violate this policy?
    
    For each violating Pod you find, please output a single line in this format: VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-002"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
isolation: cluster
