    I need you to check the Kubernetes cluster for any Services in the gk-must-have-set-of-annotations namespace that are missing required annotations. Specifically, all Services must have both the `a8r.io/owner` and `a8r.io/runbook` annotations, and their values must match the allowed patterns.
    
    Please list the names of any violating Services in that namespace.
    
    For each violating resource, print exactly one line:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-002"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
