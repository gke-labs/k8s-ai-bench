    Hey, I need help checking for policy violations in my Kubernetes cluster. I'm enforcing a policy that requires all Namespaces to have an `owner` label with a value that matches the regular expression "^[a-zA-Z]+.agilebank.demo$". Can you please check all the Namespaces cluster-wide and tell me which ones violate this policy?
    
    For each violating Namespace, please print one line like this: VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-002"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-003"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
