    I need your help checking a Kubernetes cluster for policy violations. Specifically, I want to make sure all Services in the gk-allowed-ip namespace that define external IPs are only using the allowed IP address "203.0.113.0". Please examine all Services in the gk-allowed-ip namespace and identify any that violate this policy.
    
    For each violating resource, print exactly one line:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-002"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
