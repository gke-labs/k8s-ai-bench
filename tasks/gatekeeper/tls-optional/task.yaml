    Hey, could you check the Ingress resources in the gk-tls-optional namespace? We need to make sure that all Ingresses either have TLS configured or explicitly disable HTTP by setting the `kubernetes.io/ingress.allow-http` annotation to `false`. Let me know which Ingresses violate this policy.
    
    Report each violation you find using this format:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-002"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
