    I need you to check the Pods running in the gk-allowed-repos namespace. We have a policy that all container images must come from the "openpolicyagent/" repository. Can you identify any Pods that violate this policy?
    
    For each violating resource, print one line in this format:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-002"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-003"
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-004"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
