    Hey, can you check the Kubernetes cluster for me? I need to make sure all Pods in the gk-must-have-key Namespace have a label with the key `pizza`. It doesn't matter what the value of the label is, just that the key exists.
    
    List all Pod names in the gk-must-have-key Namespace that are missing this label.
    
    For each violating resource, print exactly one line:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-002"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-001"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
